# Path Visualizer

## Overview
The Path Visualizer is a web-based application that allows users to visualize various pathfinding algorithms. The application provides a clear and interactive way to understand how algorithms like Dijkstra's, A*, and Breadth-First Search (BFS) work to find the shortest path in a grid-based environment.

## Features
- Interactive grid where users can create walls and set start and end points.
- Visualization of different pathfinding algorithms:
  - **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: A weighted algorithm that finds the shortest path between nodes in a graph.
  - **A* Search Algorithm**: An informed search algorithm that uses heuristics to improve performance in pathfinding.
  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: An unweighted algorithm that explores all neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the algorithms and handling user interactions.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.
